  <h2>📜 History of Carisbrooke Castle</h2>
</h2>
  <p>🏺 Before the Castle

The site was used in Roman times and earlier for its strategic location on a hill.

It overlooks the centre of the Isle of Wight and was a good place for defense.

🏗️ Norman Period (11th–12th Century)

After the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Normans built stone walls around an earlier wooden fort.

These walls became the base of the current castle structure.

🏰 Medieval Times

Carisbrooke Castle was strengthened with a strong gatehouse, curtain walls, and a keep (central tower).

It was never taken by force, even during attempted French invasions.

👑 King Charles I – Imprisoned

During the English Civil War, King Charles I was held prisoner here in 1647–1648.

He tried to escape through a window — but got stuck!

Soon after, he was taken to London and executed in 1649.

🧱 Later Use

The castle remained in use through the 17th century.

Princess Beatrice, daughter of Queen Victoria, lived here and helped restore parts of it in the 1800s.   </p>
